# This was a project made in CPSC 131 in CSUF
I do not claim the entire project as my own, the only file I had to work on was MyVector.hpp.
I worked with fellow classmate, Matthew Merrick, his email located below
This project's objective was to program our own vector, or a dynamic array, using classes and methods available to us.
Below is part of the original readme.md
